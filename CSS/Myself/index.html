    <h2>Education Details</h2>
    <p> 
        I did my primary schooling from Notre Dame Academy, Jamalpur(2014). After that i got shifted to Delhi where i did coaching for IIT-JEE at FIIT-JEE Hauz-Khas for next 2 years along with my 12th Standard(2013-14). There i lived in Hostel and this was the time when my hostel life started(It ended a few days ago). Later this phase ended and i got admission at BIT Mesra in CSE branch(BE/2016-2020). My journey at BIT Mesra was very exciting and i learned alot of things and made many friends (But as of now i am in contact with very few). There i got placed at Extramarks Education for BDE role where i worked for 1 month then i came home to prepare for GATE. I gave 8 months to GATE and finally got admission into IIT Ropar for Mtech in CSE. My life at IIT Ropar was very exciting and thrilling. I learned there alot but finally this journey came to an end. I am now placed in Trident Group and will be joining i a few days.
